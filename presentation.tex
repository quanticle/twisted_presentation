        \vspace{1em}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Twisted is an event driven, nonblocking, networking framework
            \item Makes it easy to develop clients and servers
            \item Built-in support for a large number of protocols
        \end{itemize}
    \end{slide}

        \vspace{1em}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Protocol
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Represents a single connection
                    \item Has callbacks that you implement to respond to various connection events
                \end{itemize}

            \item Factory
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Factory pattern that creates Protocol objects as needed
                    \item Stores cross-protocol state
                \end{itemize}

            \item Endpoint
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Represents a host/port pair
                    \item Has a factory and a reactor hooked up to it
                \end{itemize}

        \begin{center}{\LARGE Protocols, Factories, Endpoints, and Reactors (cont'd)}\end{center}
        \vspace{1em}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Reactor
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Event loop
                    \item Listens for connections and uses factory to create new protocol objects as needed
                    \item Triggers protocol callbacks as necessary
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{center}{\LARGE Twisted IRC Client}\end{center}
        \vspace{1em}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Twisted includes an IRC client class ({\ttfamily twisted.words.internet.IRCClient})
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Subclass {\ttfamily IRCClient} to make your client class
                \item Implement {\ttfamily signedOn} and {\ttfamily privmsg} methods - these are called as event handlers
            \end{itemize}
            \item Hook up your subclass to factory as usual
        \end{itemize}
    \end{slide}
